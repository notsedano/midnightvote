# Vercel Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your DJ voting application to Vercel.

## Environment Variables

Before deploying, you'll need to set up the following environment variables in Vercel:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous API key

You can find these values in your Supabase dashboard or your local .env file.

## Deployment Steps

1. You've already installed Vercel CLI and logged in
2. Run the deployment command:
   ```
   vercel
   ```

3. When prompted, follow these steps:
   - Set up and deploy: `Y`
   - Which scope: Select your account
   - Link to existing project: `N`
   - Project name: Accept default or choose a name
   - Directory: `.`
   - Want to override settings: `Y`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`
   - Development command: `npm run dev`
   - Want to modify these settings: `N`

4. When deployment completes, Vercel will provide a URL for your application.

## Environment Variable Setup in Vercel Dashboard

After deployment, go to your Vercel dashboard:

1. Select your project
2. Go to "Settings" tab
3. Click on "Environment Variables"
4. Add the two variables mentioned above
5. Save and trigger a redeployment

## CORS Configuration in Supabase

Important: After deployment, you need to update your Supabase project to allow requests from your Vercel domain:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication â†’ URL Configuration
3. Add your Vercel URL to the "Site URL" and "Redirect URLs" fields
4. Save changes

This ensures your application can communicate with Supabase from the Vercel domain.
